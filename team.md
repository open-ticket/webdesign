## Developers

TODO: include list of maintainers etc here

# Want to get involved?
Create a new GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/open-ticket/openticket-meta/issues) and we'll reach out to you with details of how to join our Slack team. Soon, we'll create a portal for automatic invites. (Probably after I finish my exams) :sob:
