# Openticket Goals
TODO: err... probably write this :thinking:

# Interested in Contributing?
Here's a copy of our contributing guidelines.

Thanks for stopping by and deciding to help improve Openticket! This guide will aim to explain how you can best shape your contribution to work with the rest of the project, helping your change to be merged as quickly as possible.

## Contributions welcome
The project is in its early stages right now, so help is appreciated in any kind of way -- from planning features/structure, to simply adding things you'd like to see as a user.

All contributions must follow our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Suggesting a feature
First and foremost, the aim of Openticket is to provide a lightweight ticketing framework that stays out of the users' way as much as possible, which means that any specialized feature/request probably won't be as strongly considered for development. Any feature request *will* be considered however! However, it may be possible for you to achieve what you want using the existing API, and the feature suggestion process will help in deciding what is the best course of action to take.

## The process
1. You have an idea for a feature to add to Openticket. Brilliant!
2. Open an issue on this repository, and make sure to tag it with the "feature request label". In your issue, try to answer as many of the following questions as possible:
  * What is the feature, and exactly would it do?
  * What data would it read/write?
  * Do you have an example of this feature in other projects/services?
  * Can you give a brief scenario explaining how it would work? (e.g., what would a user do to use the feature?)
3. While waiting for a maintainer to respond, you may find other users ask questions or support your feature request, or maybe you don't. Definitely try to answer other people's questions if they're reasonable, since it will help the maintainers learn more about the feature.
4. A maintainer may have asked some more questions about the feature, and by now there would have been a response saying how the feature will develop:
  * **Approved** -- Nice one! The feature will be worked on and added to the project at some point in the future. You may start to find a lot of activity on your issue item as people begin discussing how to implement your idea.
  * **Not required** -- The feature that you requested already exists in Openticket, or you can already use Openticket to do what you want, but perhaps not how you expected. Maybe there's a neat trick you can do with an API endpoint perhaps. However, you can definitely argue your case for the feature if this isn't sufficient for you, or more people are interested in the feature!
  * **Out of scope** -- The feature you requested doesn't fit into the scope of the Openticket project. For instance, this may be something like data visualisation, payment gateways, or other things that don't concern the events or tickets themselves.
